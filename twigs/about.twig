 * The framework assumes a self contained directory structure for a site like this :
 *
 * DOCUMENT_ROOT
 *    /sitename		This can be omitted if the site is the only one present and at the root
 *        /assets
 *            /css	CSS files
 *            /i18n	Any internationalisation files you may need
 *            /images	Image files
 *            /js	JavaScript
 *            /...	Any other stuff that can be accessed without intermediation through PHP
 *        /class	PHP class definition files named "classname.php"
 *        /errors	Files used for generating error pages.
 *        /lib		PHP files containing non-class definitions
 *        /twigcache	If twigcacheing is on this is where it caches
 *        /twigs	TWIG template files go in here
 *        /vendor	If you are using composer then it puts stuff in here.
 *
 * The .htaccess file directs
 * 	anything in /assets to be served by Apache.
 * 	anything beginning "ajax" to be called directly i.e. ajax.php
 *                  (this may or may not be useful - remove it if not)
 * 	everything else gets passed into this script where it treats the URL thus:
 * 		/		=>	/home and then
 * 		/action/r/e/st/	=>	Broken down in Context class. AN action and an array of parameters.
 * 		Query strings and/or post fields are in the $_ arrays as normal.
